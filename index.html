        Carson Pegasus Provincial Park
    </h2>
    <p>
        Carson Pegasus Provincial Park is without a doubt one of my top 5 places to see in Alberta, Canada, offering serene lakes, lush forests, and excellent camping opportunities. 
                I love this park because it's somewhere where you can go to take a break from life. Every year me and my family go camp within the park and often bike and walk throughout the forest.
