        Carson Pegasus Provincial Park
    </h2>
    <p>
        Carson Pegasus Provincial Park is without a doubt one of my top 5 places to see in Alberta, Canada, offering serene lakes, lush forests, and excellent camping opportunities. 
                I love this park because it's somewhere where you can go to take a break from life. Every year me and my family go camp within the park and often bike and walk throughout the forest.

    <h2>Jasper Park Lodges</h2>
            <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/30494968/pexels-photo-30494968.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" alt="A beautiful red sky sunset in Jasper National Park">
            <p>
                Jasper Park Lodges offers yet another great escape in the heart of Jasper National Park. This resort provides breathtaking 
                mountain views, cozy log cabins, and world-class amenities. I particularly enjoy the sunsets and the surroundings and the abundance of wildlife, including elk 
                and deer. I do have a really funny and dangerous story with elk during mating season if you ever want to hear about it. (I took a video of the whole incident. I blame Molson Canadian for letting this happen)

    <h2>Mexico</h2>
            <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/30494967/pexels-photo-30494967.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" alt="A stunning beach in Mexico">
            <p>
                Mexico is a vibrant country with diverse landscapes, rich culture, and delicious cuisine. From the beaches of Cancun to the historic ruins of 
                Chichen Itza, there is something for everyone. I actually dont enjoy Mexico for its warm climate. I enjoy it for its killer all you can eat lobster tails.
